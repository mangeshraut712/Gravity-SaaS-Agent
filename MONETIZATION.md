1.  **Pick One Niche**: Don't try to be everything. Be the "Real Estate Lead Bot" guy.
2.  **Deploy**: Use the `install.sh` script on a VPS.
3.  **Build the Skill**: Use MCP to connect the specific tool you need (e.g., Zillow API or LinkedIn Scraper).
4.  **Sell**: Pitch the *outcome* ("Automatic qualified leads"), not the technology ("AI Agent").
